# Developer docs (placeholder)

This directory is for developer-facing documentation: CI configuration, performance testing, developer primitives and local workflows.

It's intentionally minimal in the template. When you start a project from this template, add concrete details such as:

- CI configuration and badges
- How to run tests on CI (Release / ASAN / coverage builds)
- Local debug tips and helper scripts
- Performance and benchmarking notes

See `scripts/README.md` for the canonical script-first workflow in this template.
