# Architecture (placeholder)

This file is the canonical starting place for high-level architecture notes for the project.

Keep architecture documents short and focused. Examples of useful content:

- high-level subsystem diagrams (Mermaid flowcharts encouraged)
- data flow and threading model (important for audio projects)
- state machines and life-cycle boundaries
- module dependencies and reasons for those dependencies

This template intentionally provides a placeholder so every derived project starts with a location to describe the architecture decisions.
