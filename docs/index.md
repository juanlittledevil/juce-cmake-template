## Documentation — Project Template

This repository is a JUCE CMake template intended to be a starting point for new audio plugin projects.

This `docs/index.md` is a canonical **project-agnostic** entry point for documentation in projects derived from this template. Keep it short and link to more detailed pages in `docs/dev/` and `docs/architecture/`.

Quick links

- 📘 Getting started — follow the top-level README for quick setup: `README.md`
- 🛠 Scripts & developer tooling — see `scripts/README.md` for build, run and test helpers.
- 🧪 Tests & CI — see `tests/README.md` for testing conventions and how to run project tests.
- 🏗 Architecture — see `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` for architecture notes (placeholder).

Why this page exists

This template aims to provide a consistent, discoverable documentation entry-point so every new project has the same structure and the same starting place for developer docs.

How to expand

- Add project-specific developer docs under `docs/dev/` (e.g., CI, debug workflows, performance measurement).
- Keep `docs/architecture/` for high-level design and state-machine descriptions.
- Add a `docs/issues/` file for any issue/epic documentation if creating issues scoped to the project.

If you generated your own project from this template, update this page early on to reflect your project's unique decisions and links.
